Let it slow.

Stay with what you feel and watch what appears.`,
  },
  {
    id: "anger-1",
    user: "I am so angry at everyone",
    reply: `Anger is a fire the mind lights when reality refuses to obey it.

    id: "betrayal-1",
    user: "My best friend betrayed me",
    reply: `Betrayal hurts because the image you held of them is breaking.

Sit with the answer and observe.`,

  {
    id: "loneliness-1",
    user: "I feel so alone",
    reply: `Loneliness appears when you are disconnected from yourself first, and from others second.

Watch gently.`,
  },
  {
    id: "fear-1",
    user: "I am afraid of the future",
    reply: `Fear is imagination pretending to be truth.

Feel your body right now. Notice what is actually happening here, not in the story.

Rest in the difference.`,
  },
  {
    id: "regret-1",
    user: "I regret my past decisions",
    reply: `Regret is the mind clinging to a past it cannot change.

  },
  {
    id: "shame-1",
    user: "I feel ashamed of who I am",
    reply: `Shame is a self-image collapsing. This can be a doorway, not a curse.

Observe without judgment.`,
  },
  {
    id: "self-doubt-1",
    user: "I don't believe in myself",
    reply: `Doubt is a cloud passing through the sky of your awareness.

You are not the cloud.

Feel the breath. Let the doubt be there.

Stay with that awareness.`,

    id: "lost-1",

Listen quietly.`,
  },
