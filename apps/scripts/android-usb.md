# Samsung USB Debugging Checklist

1. Enable Developer Options
   - Settings -> About phone -> Software information -> Tap "Build number" seven times.
   - Enter device PIN to confirm.
2. Enable USB debugging
   - Settings -> Developer options -> Enable "USB debugging".
3. Connect via USB-C and authorize
   - Plug the phone into your computer.
   - Confirm the RSA fingerprint prompt on the device (select "Always allow").
4. Verify connection
   - Run `adb devices` to ensure the device shows as `device` (not `unauthorized`).
5. Troubleshooting
   - If `unauthorized`, toggle USB debugging off/on and re-accept the prompt.
   - If multiple devices listed, use `adb -s <deviceId> ...` with the ID from `adb devices`.
   - For build cache issues, run `cd apps/mobile && ./gradlew clean` inside the android directory generated by Expo prebuild.
6. Install TalkingLight debug build
   - From repo root: `cd apps/mobile`
   - `npx expo run:android`

Once installed, the Expo development build will automatically launch on the Samsung device.
